        <h3>Storyboarding for Non-Linear Media</h3>
        <p>In this lab and class, we discussed the different approaches to storyboarding content:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Linear</strong> - Plans a single, fixed path.</li>
          <li><strong>Non-Linear</strong> - Plans a system of possible paths.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reverse Engineering Discussion</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest differences in my partner’s (Ella) approach was how much detail she put into the interactive elements of her storyboards. She created significantly more boards overall and spent a lot of time breaking down each slide with detailed annotations. While this level of detail might be time-consuming or even impractical in an industry setting where frequent changes are expected, it was interesting to see how thoroughly she thought through every interaction. I also found her use of different colours and labels to distinguish interactive elements especially effective, as it clearly communicated what parts of the environment were meant to be engaged with. Overall, the differences enhanced the clarity of the storyboards rather than making them harder to interpret. The added interactive highlights made it much easier to understand how a player would move through the experience and what elements they could jump to or interact with. This was particularly helpful for visualizing user flow in a non-linear context, where understanding possible actions is just as important as understanding the visuals themselves. After reviewing my partner’s storyboards, I would consider incorporating more visual emphasis on interactive areas in my own work. Adding clearer highlights or visual cues for platforms and sections that players can interact with would help communicate intent more effectively, especially for collaborators who may not be as familiar with the project. While I would still aim to keep the level of detail manageable, borrowing some of these clarity-focused techniques could strengthen my storyboards overall.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Previsualization is important in both linear and non-linear media, but it functions a bit differently depending on how the audience interacts with the work. In linear media like film or animation, previsualization is mostly about planning a fixed sequence. Tools such as storyboards and animatics help map out timing, pacing, and where the viewer’s attention should be at any given moment. Since everyone experiences the content in the same order, the focus is on clearly guiding the viewer through the narrative.
For non-linear media, like interactive websites or immersive experiences, previsualization has to account for user choice. Instead of designing one clear path, the process involves planning multiple possible routes a user might take. This often means using flowcharts, wireframes, or user journey maps to think through interactions, decision points, and how users move through information. The goal here is less about precise timing and more about clarity, usability, and making sure users don’t get lost.
That said, there are a lot of similarities between the two. In both cases, previsualization helps externalize ideas, catch problems early, and communicate intent with collaborators before moving into production. Both approaches are also iterative and prioritize clarity over polish in the early stages.
Overall, the main difference comes down to control. Linear previsualization is about choreographing a single experience over time, while non-linear previsualization is about designing a system that responds to user input. Understanding this distinction helps determine how to approach planning depending on the type of media being created.</p>
