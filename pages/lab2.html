      <div class="learning-section">
        <h3>CSS Layout Techniques</h3>
        <p>In this lab, I explored two powerful CSS layout systems:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flexbox</strong> - Perfect for one-dimensional layouts like navigation bars</li>
          <li><strong>CSS Grid</strong> - Ideal for two-dimensional layouts like image galleries</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="learning-section">
        <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
        <p>I learned how to make websites adapt to different screen sizes using media queries. This ensures my site looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Through this process, I learned how to update my website to look more polished while also improving its accessibility. One of my main challenges was trying to merge the technical skills I was learning with the original vision I developed in Lab 1. At times, it felt difficult to translate that vision into code, but through a lot of experimentation and problem-solving (and plenty of Googling), I was able to get closer to what I had imagined. That said, there are still several aspects I want to refine and better understand, such as resolving the misalignment between my "About Me" column and the lab entries column. Overall, this experience highlighted both how much I've learned and how much room there still is for growth, which feels motivating rather than discouraging.</p>
