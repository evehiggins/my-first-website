        <h3>Learning About Spline</h3>
        <p>In this lab I explored how to use, design, and integrate Spline 3D environments into web projects. I learned how to create interactive 3D scenes using Spline's visual editor and embed them in web pages using the Spline Viewer component.</p>

        <h3>Spline Discussion</h3>
        <p> I recently learned how to use Spline by following an online tutorial that walked through building a simple robot, adding interactivity, and embedding the final model into a webpage. Overall, the experience was very smooth, Spline felt intuitive and beginner-friendly, especially for quickly creating interactive 3D content without a steep learning curve. That said, I did find it frustrating that some features were unexpectedly locked behind a paywall, which interrupted the flow of experimentation and learning. Even with that limitation, Spline seems like a powerful and accessible tool for integrating 3D elements into web design, particularly for rapid prototyping and visual storytelling.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Learning Spline through this tutorial was an overall positive experience, especially in how quickly I was able to build an interactive 3D robot and embed it into a webpage. The workflow felt smooth and approachable, which made experimenting with 3D on the web feel far less intimidating than I expected. That said, as I spent more time with my model, I noticed that the lighting and shading felt overly harsh, simultaneously too bright and too dark, which is something I would like to continue refining as I become more comfortable with Spline’s rendering controls.

While I enjoyed using Spline, I’m also interested in exploring alternative ways to integrate 3D models into websites that don’t rely solely on its platform. In particular, I’m curious about working directly with libraries like THREE.js, which may offer more flexibility and control over lighting, materials, and interactions. Overall, this experience has been a strong introduction to web-based 3D, and it’s encouraged me to experiment further with both visual polish and more customizable technical approaches</p>
